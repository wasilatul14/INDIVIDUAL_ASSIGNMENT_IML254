Let me introduce about myself first. My name is Wasilatul 'Athiyyah binti Mohammad Jali. I was born on 14 June 2004 in Hospital Sultanah Nur Zahirah, Kuala Terengganu, Terengganu. My name was given to me by my late grandfather which means "connector of grace". Other than that, the nickname my family always uses is kakak or kak wa. This is because I am the eldest of four siblings.

I turned 20 years old this year. At this age, I think it's very challenging for me because I need to be an independent to do things on my own especially in a new place. I am grateful for being able to adapt well even though I am far away from my family.

Singing and watching television are my pastimes. Typically, I'll watch a variety of programs, such as the Korean show Running Man. Aside from that, I enjoy watching thrillers and dramas. I prefer to sing, even though it's not the most pleasant sound to listen to, to keep myself from feeling lonely and drowsy when I'm working.

My late father was a teacher, so when I was in elementary school, I wanted to be a teacher too. Then, after completing SPM, I applied to IPG, but my application was denied. Still, I feel happy with the field I'm now studying in.
