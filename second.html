I spent three years of my education at SMA Mahmudiah in Kuala Berang, Terengganu, from 2017 to 2019. I was unable to continue with the Arabic course, therefore after the PT3 exam, I made the decision to change schools. My parents were against it at first, but in the end, they agreed to let me change schools.

In 2020, I enrolled in SMK Tengku Ampuan Intan, Kuala Berang, Terengganu, following the Chinese New Year holiday. After a few months of instruction, the corona virus-19 outbreak rocked our nation and forced the closure of all schools. I had to study online for the entirety of the fourth and fifth grades as a result. That's why I don't remember much about my new school.
